        <h1> Jinming Yu </h1>
        <p> I believe in <b>passion</b>. My heart is leading the way, instead of my brain. I code because I love solving problems in the most simplified way.
            I believe in <b>cooperation</b>. Inspirations from people in various fields give my codes life and value, so I am always willing to work with people.
            I believe in <b>perserverance</b>.
        </p>
